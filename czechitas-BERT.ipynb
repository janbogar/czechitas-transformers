        "# Transformers for text processing\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformers are neural networks that changed how we model sequential data.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many kinds of data that are sequential in nature, for example time series, but i.e. text is also just a sequence of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "State of the art in these areas used to be recurrent neural networks. They work by taking as an input not just an item in the sequence, but also the output of the network on the previous item. This way, the output of the network can contain the memmory of what happened previously.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem with recurrent neural networks was difficulty of training them in parallel. They also had trouble learning relationships between words that were far away from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformers work quite differently. All of the sequence is shown to the network at once, and a special architecture called attention head (transformers usually have multiple) predict to which parts of sentence should the network pay attention when processing each word.\n",
        "\n",
        "Famous transformer-based language models are e.g. BERT and GPT3, but there are many more variants, such as RoBERTa, ALBERT, or ELECTRA.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Model\n",
        "In this notebook we will use BERT model trained and published by researches at  West Bohemia University. The model is called Czert and the authors experimented with it on many tasks:\n",
        " - Sequence Classification (**Sentiment Classification**, Multi-label Document Classification)\n",
        " - Sequence Pair Classification (Semantic Text Similarity)\n",
        " -Token Classification (Morphological Tagging, Named Entity Recognition,\n",

        "# Sentiment analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will use the model trained specifically for sentiment analysis. In sentiment analysis, model attempts to classify short texts (oftne social media statuses or customer reviews) as either positive, negative or neutral.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thee authors published two versions of the model, one trained on reviews from www.csfd.cz and other trained on facebook statuses. Both datasets are available on their webpage.\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors claim, that this model had F1 score of\n",
        "77%  on CSFD data and 85% percent on FB data, which they claim are better than the state of the art before this model.\n",
        "F1 score is hard to interpret without knowledge of precission and recall metrics, but for now, let's just say it corresponds somehow to the accuracy of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the model has 75% accuracy, it still makes an error in one quarter of cases. That means that there is still a huge potential for error.\n",
        "\n",
        "In following cells, we will download this model and try to use it."

Since internal layers are usually large, it often has many dimensions (e.g. for transformers it could be 256 or 512). The hope is, that this embedding reflects high level features that summarize the data, but is yet not specific to the task we trained the model on.\n",
